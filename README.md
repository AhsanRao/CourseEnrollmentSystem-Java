# CourseEnrollmentSystem Java
 This is a console-based program written in Java for course enrollment management. It allows students to search for a course by keyword, enroll in a course, display all their enrolled courses, withdraw from a course, and exit the program. The program reads course information from a CSV file and outputs the new CSV file with updated student enrollment numbers.
